## Stakeholders
**Interviewee Profile:** Sarah, Junior at New York University 
**Current Living Situation:** Looking for off-campus housing after living in Third North residence hall

### Goals/Needs:
1. Find housing within a $1,500-2,000/month budget range that's within walking distance to Washington Square campus or easily accessible by subway
2. Locate roommates (preferably other NYU students) with similar academic schedules and lifestyle habits
3. Secure housing at least 3 months before the semester starts due to NYC's competitive rental market
4. Find roommates who can provide guarantors or have sufficient income for NYC landlord requirements
5. Connect with potential roommates who understand the unique challenges of student life in Manhattan

### Problems/Frustrations:
1. Most NYC apartment listings are through brokers requiring expensive broker fees (typically 15% of annual rent)
2. Standard NYC housing websites like StreetEasy aren't tailored for student budgets or roommate situations
3. Difficulty finding short-term leases that align with academic year (many landlords require 12-month commitments)
4. NYU Facebook housing groups are flooded with posts, making it hard to filter legitimate offers
5. Many listings in popular student areas (East Village, Greenwich Village) get taken within hours
6. Hard to verify if potential roommates are actually NYU students
7. Challenging to coordinate viewing appointments between classes and other commitments
8. Concerned about safety when meeting potential roommates in the city

### Interview Key Quotes:
1. "The NYC housing market moves so fast - by the time I see a listing in my price range near campus, it's usually gone."
2. "I wish there was an easy way to find other NYU students looking for roommates. The Facebook groups are chaotic, and you never know if people are actually students."
3. "It's really hard to find places that don't require a broker fee or that offer flexible lease terms for study abroad programs."
4. "Most affordable listings are far from campus, but I need to be able to quickly get to my classes in different NYU buildings around the Village."

## Product Vision Statement
HousingFinder connects NYU students with verified roommates and pre-vetted housing options near campus, simplifying the challenge of finding safe, affordable student housing in New York City.
