## Stakeholders
**Interviewee Profile:** Sarah, Junior at New York University 
**Current Living Situation:** Looking for off-campus housing after living in Third North residence hall


## Product Vision Statement
HousingFinder connects NYU students with verified roommates and pre-vetted housing options near campus, simplifying the challenge of finding safe, affordable student housing in New York City. 


## User Requirements

1. "As an NYU student, I want to verify my student status with my NYU email so that I know I'm connecting with real NYU students."
2. "As a student looking for housing, I want to filter apartments by walking distance to specific NYU buildings so that I can easily get to my classes."
3. "As an international student, I want to find roommates who can provide qualified guarantors so that we can meet NYC landlord requirements together."
4. "As a student planning to study abroad, I want to search for short-term lease options so that I can find housing that matches my academic schedule."
5. "As a potential tenant, I want to see which subway lines are near each apartment so that I can plan my commute to different NYU buildings."
6. "As a student with a budget, I want to filter listings by total cost (including utilities) so that I can find affordable options within my price range."
7. "As a female student, I want to specify my preference for female roommates so that I can feel more comfortable in my living situation."
8. "As a busy student, I want to schedule apartment viewings through the app so that I can coordinate times that work with my class schedule."
9. "As a potential roommate, I want to create a detailed profile with my sleep schedule and study habits so that I can match with compatible roommates."
10. "As an apartment seeker, I want to receive instant notifications for new listings in my preferred areas so that I don't miss out on good opportunities."
11. "As a student subletting my room, I want to verify potential subletters' NYU status so that I can ensure they're eligible for my building."
12. "As a first-time NYC renter, I want to see a checklist of required documents so that I can prepare everything needed for apartment applications."
